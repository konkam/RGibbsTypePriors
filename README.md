Computing clusters prior distribution for Gibbs-type processes.

## Introduction


The following reference gives an overview of Gibbs-type priors and their importance for Bayesian Nonparametrics:

De Blasi, Pierpaolo, Stefano Favaro, Antonio Lijoi, Ramsés H. Mena, Igor Prünster, and Matteo Ruggiero. “Are Gibbs-Type Priors the Most Natural Generalization of the Dirichlet Process?” IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 37, no. 2 (2015): 212–29. https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2013.217.


An application of the functions implemented in this package was presented here:
